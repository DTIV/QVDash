This project utilizes the covalent API to get contract metadata and display information about the organization such as contract address, name and logo.&#x20;

This project uses covalent API to create a multi-chain compatible Interface. Users can be connected to any Covalent supported network where the project is deployed. Organizations can add contracts from any supported Covalent network to show users information about there organization and the proposals created for Quadratic Voting.

An API Key will be needed to run this project locally and a free API Key can be obtained here:
