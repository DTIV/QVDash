# Quadratic Voting

Democracies have generally used one person, one vote in their elections and legislative processes which is faster and quite easy to implement than some other voting mechanism. But it doesn't allow members to express the degree of their preferences and also ignores the minorities. Other major voting mechanisms such as Proportional Voting and Ranked Choice Voting are quite complex and hard to implement. To solve the issues of voting paradox and majority rule quadratic voting comes into the picture.

{% hint style="info" %}
Quadratic voting is a collective decision-making procedure that involves individuals allocating votes to express the degree of their preferences, rather than just the direction of their preferences. Participants aren't just voting for or against an issue, they are also showing how strongly they care about that issue.
{% endhint %}

### How it works

Each participant is given a number of credits that can be used to vote for an issue and the cost of casting more than one vote for an issue is quadratic, not linear. So, the marginal cost of each additional vote is far higher than that of the previous vote.

$$
costToVoter = (votes Casted)^2
$$

So, if a user wants to cast one vote it'll cost them one credit.

For casting 2 votes, it'll take (2)^2 = 4 credits.

For casting 3 votes, it'll take (3)^3 = 9 credits.

And it keeps increasing exponentially this way.

### Conclusion

The quadratic nature of the voting suggests that a voter can use their votes more efficiently by spreading them across many issues. This way of voting is quite efficient and robust and provides solutions to issues such as majority rule. Quadratic Voting can be used in democratic institutions, in corporate governance, and blockchain-enabled collective decision-making.
